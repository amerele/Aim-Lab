reaction, aim and some other important components for FPS games.

# 🎯 How does it works?

- After opening the website project, click "START"
- Three red targets will appear on your screen (They're responsively sized based on your screen)
- Shoot as many targets as possible

After 60sec, you'll get a report of your hits, misses and accuracy.
Try again to see if you can be better next time...
